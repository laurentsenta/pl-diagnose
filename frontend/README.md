# PL Diagnose - Frontend

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup

- Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine
- Once NodeJS is installed, install [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) using `npm install --global yarn`, then check the install with `yarn --version`.

If you use `nvm`, `nvm use` will setup the correct node version or prompt you to install it.

## Usage

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
